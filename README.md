<h1>Formedix Coding Task</h1>


<h3>This project is used to develop 5 API based on currency</h3>

<h4>Stack used: Java, Spring boot, MySQL</h4>

<p>
API 1: Currency name list </br>
API 2: Exchange Rate of a currency on a datae </br>
API 3: Convert currency on a given date </br>
API 4: Find highest exchange rate of a currency on a given time period.</br>
API 5: Find average exchange rate of a currency on a given time period. </br>

Details of the API can be found on the API documentation which can be found from: 
<br>https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3556359/TzmCgsfC</br>
</p>


<p>
<b>Note: For memory limitation, currency exchange rate data are available for 2021-06-17 to 2021-07-15. So the API will not
give data before 2021-06-17 and after 2021-07-15</b>
